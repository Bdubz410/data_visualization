Here I have created three Data Visualization projects.
Project 1: I learned to generate data and created a series of functional visualizations of that data using Matplotlib and Plotly.
Project 2: I learned how to access data from online sources and feed it into a visualization package to create plots of weather data and a map of global earthquake activity.
Project 3: Learned how to write a program to automatically download and visualize data. 
These projects allowed me to explore the field of data science.
